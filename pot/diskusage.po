msgid "Each table has a primary heap disk file where most of the data is stored. If the table has any columns with potentially-wide values, there also might be a <acronym>TOAST</acronym> file associated with the table, which is used to store values too wide to fit comfortably in the main table (see <xref linkend=\"storage-toast\"/>). There will be one index on the <acronym>TOAST</acronym> table, if present. There also might be indexes associated with the base table. Each table and index is stored in a separate disk file â€” possibly more than one file, if the file would exceed one gigabyte. Naming conventions for these files are described in <xref linkend=\"storage-file-layout\"/>."
