msgid "This command displays the execution plan that the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> planner generates for the supplied statement.

msgid "The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in units of disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up time before the first row can be returned, and the total time to return all the rows. For most queries the total time is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in <literal>EXISTS</literal>, the planner will choose the smallest start-up time instead of the smallest total time (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a <literal>LIMIT</literal> clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest."
