msgid "<type>citext</type>'s case-folding behavior depends on the <literal>LC_CTYPE</literal> setting of your database. How it compares values is therefore determined when the database is created. It is not truly case-insensitive in the terms defined by the Unicode standard. Effectively, what this means is that, as long as you're happy with your collation, you should be happy with <type>citext</type>'s comparisons. But if you have data in different languages stored in your database, users of one language may find their query results are not as expected if the collation is for another language."

Currently, <type>citext</type> operators will honor a non-default <literal>COLLATE</literal> specification while comparing case-folded strings, but the initial folding to lower case is always done according to the database's <literal>LC_CTYPE</literal> setting (that is, as though <literal>COLLATE \"default\"</literal> were given).

msgid "<type>citext</type> doesn't help much if you need data to compare case-sensitively in some contexts and case-insensitively in other contexts. The standard answer is to use the <type>text</type> type and manually use the <function>lower</function> function when you need to compare case-insensitively; this works all right if case-insensitive comparison is needed only infrequently. If you need case-insensitive behavior most of the time and case-sensitive infrequently, consider storing the data as <type>citext</type> and explicitly casting the column to <type>text</type> when you want case-sensitive comparison.
