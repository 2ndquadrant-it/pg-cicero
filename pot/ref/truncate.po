msgid "<command>TRUNCATE</command> quickly removes all rows from a set of tables.

Furthermore, it reclaims disk space immediately, rather than requiring a subsequent <command>VACUUM</command> operation. This is most useful on large tables."

msgid "<command>TRUNCATE</command> is not MVCC-safe (see <xref linkend=\"mvcc\"/> for general information about MVCC). After truncation, the table will appear empty to all concurrent transactions, even if they are using a snapshot taken before the truncation occurred. This will only be an issue for a transaction that did not access the truncated table before the truncation happened — any transaction that has done so would hold at least an <literal>ACCESS SHARE</literal> lock, which would block <command>TRUNCATE</command> until that transaction completes. So truncation will not cause any apparent inconsistency in the table contents for successive queries on the same table, but it could cause visible inconsistency between the contents of the truncated table and other tables in the database."

This is unlike the normal behavior of <command>ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART</command>. Be aware that if any additional sequence operations are done on the restarted sequences before the transaction rolls back, the effects of these operations on the sequences will be rolled back, but not their effects on <function>currval()</function>; that is, after the transaction <function>currval()</function> will continue to reflect the last sequence value obtained inside the failed transaction, even though the sequence itself may no longer be consistent with that.
