msgid "This chapter defines the interface between the core <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> system and <firstterm>index access methods</firstterm>, which manage individual index types. The core system knows nothing about indexes beyond what is specified here, so it is possible to develop entirely new index types by writing add-on code."

Each index is stored as its own physical <firstterm>relation</firstterm> and so is described by an entry in the <structname>pg_class</structname> catalog. The contents of an index are entirely under the control of its index access method. In practice, all index access methods divide indexes into standard-size pages so that they can use the regular storage manager and buffer manager to access the index contents. (All the existing index access methods furthermore use the standard page layout described in <xref linkend=\"storage-page-layout\"/>, and they all use the same format for index tuple headers; but these decisions are not forced on an access method.)"

msgid "An index is effectively a mapping from some data key values to <firstterm>tuple identifiers</firstterm>, or <acronym>TIDs</acronym>, of row versions (tuples) in the index's parent table. A TID consists of a block number and an item number within that block (see <xref linkend=\"storage-page-layout\"/>). This is sufficient information to fetch a particular row version from the table. Indexes are not directly aware that under MVCC, there might be multiple extant versions of the same logical row; to an index, each tuple is an independent object that needs its own index entry. Thus, an update of a row always creates all-new index entries for the row, even if the key values did not change. (HOT tuples are an exception to this statement; but indexes do not deal with those, either.) Index entries for dead tuples are reclaimed (by vacuuming) when the dead tuples themselves are reclaimed."

The index columns (key values) can be either simple columns of the underlying table or expressions over the table rows. The index access method normally has no interest in where the index key values come from (it is always handed precomputed key values) but it will be very interested in the operator class information in <structname>pg_index</structname>.

msgid "Some of the flag columns of <structname>pg_am</structname> have nonobvious implications. The requirements of <structfield>amcanunique</structfield> are discussed in <xref linkend=\"index-unique-checks\"/>. The <structfield>amcanmulticol</structfield> flag asserts that the access method supports multicolumn indexes, while <structfield>amoptionalkey</structfield> asserts that it allows scans where no indexable restriction clause is given for the first index column. When <structfield>amcanmulticol</structfield> is false, <structfield>amoptionalkey</structfield> essentially says whether the access method supports full-index scans without any restriction clause. Access methods that support multiple index columns <emphasis>must</emphasis> support scans that omit restrictions on any or all of the columns after the first; however they are permitted to require some restriction to appear for the first index column, and this is signaled by setting <structfield>amoptionalkey</structfield> false. One reason that an index AM might set <structfield>amoptionalkey</structfield> false is if it doesn't index NULLs. Since most indexable operators are strict and hence cannot return TRUE for NULL inputs, it is at first sight attractive to not store index entries for null values: they could never be returned by an index scan anyway. However, this argument fails when an index scan has no restriction clause for a given index column. In practice this means that indexes that have <structfield>amoptionalkey</structfield> true must index nulls, since the planner might decide to use such an index with no scan keys at all. A related restriction is that an index access method that supports multiple index columns <emphasis>must</emphasis> support indexing null values in columns after the first, because the planner will assume the index can be used for queries that do not restrict these columns. For example, consider an index on (a,b) and a query with <literal>WHERE a = 4</literal>. The system will assume the index can be used to scan for rows with <literal>a = 4</literal>, which is wrong if the index omits rows where <literal>b</literal> is null. It is, however, OK to omit rows where the first indexed column is null. An index access method that does index nulls may also set <structfield>amsearchnulls</structfield>, indicating that it supports <literal>IS NULL</literal> and <literal>IS NOT NULL</literal> clauses as search conditions."

We handle this problem with the following rules: <placeholder-1/> Without the third rule, it is possible for an index reader to see an index entry just before it is removed by <command>VACUUM</command>, and then to arrive at the corresponding heap entry after that was removed by <command>VACUUM</command>.

When using an MVCC-compliant snapshot, there is no problem because the new occupant of the slot is certain to be too new to pass the snapshot test. However, with a non-MVCC-compliant snapshot (such as <literal>SnapshotNow</literal>), it would be possible to accept and return a row that does not in fact match the scan keys. We could defend against this scenario by requiring the scan keys to be rechecked against the heap row in all cases, but that is too expensive.
