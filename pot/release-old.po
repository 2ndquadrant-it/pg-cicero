It has long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations such as <command>VACUUM FULL</command>, which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations (including <command>VACUUM</command>, <command>ANALYZE</command>, <command>REINDEX</command>, and <command>CLUSTER</command>) to execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal> functions.

Writers continue to use the compact pg_log transaction system. This is all performed without having to allocate a lock for every row like traditional database systems.

msgid "\nIncompatible changes:\n * BETA-0.3 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH DATABASES CREATED WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS\n   (due to system catalog changes and indexing structure changes).\n * double-quote (\") is deprecated as a quoting character for string literals;\n   you need to convert them to single quotes ('). \n * name of aggregates (eg. int4sum) are renamed in accordance with the\n   SQL standard (eg. sum).\n * CHANGE ACL syntax is replaced by GRANT/REVOKE syntax.\n * float literals (eg. 3.14) are now of type float4 (instead of float8 in\n   previous releases); you might have to do typecasting if you depend on it\n   being of type float8.  If you neglect to do the typecasting and you assign\n   a float literal to a field of type float8, you might get incorrect values\n   stored!\n * LIBPQ has been totally revamped so that frontend applications\n   can connect to multiple backends\n * the usesysid field in pg_user has been changed from int2 to int4 to\n   allow wider range of Unix user ids.\n * the netbsd/freebsd/bsd o/s ports have been consolidated into a\n   single BSD44_derived port.  (thanks to Alistair Crooks)\n\nSQL standard-compliance (the following details changes that makes postgres95\nmore compliant to the SQL-92 standard):\n * the following SQL types are now built-in: smallint, int(eger), float, real,\n   char(N), varchar(N), date and time.\n\n   The following are aliases to existing postgres types:\n                smallint -&gt; int2\n                integer, int -&gt; int4\n                float, real  -&gt; float4\n   char(N) and varchar(N) are implemented as truncated text types. In\n   addition, char(N) does blank-padding.\n * single-quote (') is used for quoting string literals; '' (in addition to\n   \\') is supported as means of inserting a single quote in a string\n * SQL standard aggregate names (MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, COUNT) are used\n   (Also, aggregates can now be overloaded, i.e. you can define your\n   own MAX aggregate to take in a user-defined type.)\n * CHANGE ACL removed. GRANT/REVOKE syntax added.\n   - Privileges can be given to a group using the \"GROUP\" key word.\n        For example:\n                GRANT SELECT ON foobar TO GROUP my_group;\n        The key word 'PUBLIC' is also supported to mean all users.\n\n        Privileges can only be granted or revoked to one user or group\n        at a time.\n\n        \"WITH GRANT OPTION\" is not supported.  Only class owners can change\n        access control\n   - The default access control is to grant users readonly access.\n     You must explicitly grant insert/update access to users.  To change\n     this, modify the line in\n                src/backend/utils/acl.h\n     that defines ACL_WORLD_DEFAULT\n\nBug fixes:\n * the bug where aggregates of empty tables were not run has been fixed. Now,\n   aggregates run on empty tables will return the initial conditions of the\n   aggregates. Thus, COUNT of an empty  table will now properly return 0.\n   MAX/MIN of an empty table will return a row of value NULL.\n * allow the use of \\; inside the monitor\n * the LISTEN/NOTIFY asynchronous notification mechanism now work\n * NOTIFY in rule action bodies now work\n * hash indexes work, and access methods in general should perform better.\n   creation of large btree indexes should be much faster.  (thanks to Paul\n   Aoki)\n\nOther changes and enhancements:\n * addition of an EXPLAIN statement used for explaining the query execution\n   plan (eg. \"EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM EMP\" prints out the execution plan for\n   the query).\n * WARN and NOTICE messages no longer have timestamps on them. To turn on\n   timestamps of error messages, uncomment the line in\n   src/backend/utils/elog.h:\n        /* define ELOG_TIMESTAMPS */\n * On an access control violation, the message\n        \"Either no such class or insufficient privilege\"\n   will be given.  This is the same message that is returned when\n   a class is not found.  This dissuades non-privileged users from\n   guessing the existence of privileged classes.\n * some additional system catalog changes have been made that are not\n   visible to the user.\n\nlibpgtcl changes:\n * The -oid option has been added to the \"pg_result\" tcl command.\n   pg_result -oid returns oid of the last row inserted.   If the\n   last command was not an INSERT, then pg_result -oid returns \"\".\n * the large object interface is available as pg_lo* tcl commands:\n   pg_lo_open, pg_lo_close, pg_lo_creat, etc.\n\nPortability enhancements and New Ports:\n * flex/lex problems have been cleared up.  Now, you should be able to use\n   flex instead of lex on any platforms.  We no longer make assumptions of\n   what lexer you use based on the platform you use.\n * The Linux-ELF port is now supported.  Various configuration have been\n   tested:  The following configuration is known to work:\n        kernel 1.2.10, gcc 2.6.3, libc 4.7.2, flex 2.5.2, bison 1.24\n   with everything in ELF format,\n\nNew utilities:\n * ipcclean added to the distribution\n   ipcclean usually does not need to be run, but if your backend crashes\n   and leaves shared memory segments hanging around, ipcclean will\n   clean them up for you.\n\nNew documentation:\n * the user manual has been revised and libpq documentation added.\n"
