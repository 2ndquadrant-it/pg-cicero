In this case plausible values will be substituted for the missing data. Most of the fields can be expected to match, but manual assistance might be needed for the next OID, next transaction ID and epoch, next multitransaction ID and offset, and WAL starting address fields. These fields can be set using the switches discussed below. If you are not able to determine correct values for all these fields, <literal>-f</literal> can still be used, but the recovered database must be treated with even more suspicion than usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative. <emphasis>Do not</emphasis> execute any data-modifying operations in the database before you dump, as any such action is likely to make the corruption worse."

For example, if <filename>0011</filename> is the largest entry in <filename>pg_clog</filename>, <literal>-x 0x1200000</literal> will work (five trailing zeroes provide the proper multiplier)."
