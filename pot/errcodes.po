Applications that need to know which error condition has occurred should usually test the error code, rather than looking at the textual error message. The error codes are less likely to change across <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> releases, and also are not subject to change due to localization of error messages. Note that some, but not all, of the error codes produced by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> are defined by the SQL standard; some additional error codes for conditions not defined by the standard have been invented or borrowed from other databases."
