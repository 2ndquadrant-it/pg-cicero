#: /tmp/cicero-PnJu/lo.xml:20(para) 
msgid "One of the problems with the JDBC driver (and this affects the ODBC driver also), is that the specification assumes that references to BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects) are stored within a table, and if that entry is changed, the associated BLOB is deleted from the database."
msgstr ""

#: /tmp/cicero-PnJu/lo.xml:27(para) 
msgid "As <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> stands, this doesn't occur. Large objects are treated as objects in their own right; a table entry can reference a large object by OID, but there can be multiple table entries referencing the same large object OID, so the system doesn't delete the large object just because you change or remove one such entry."
msgstr ""

#: /tmp/cicero-PnJu/lo.xml:35(para) 
msgid "Now this is fine for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>-specific applications, but standard code using JDBC or ODBC won't delete the objects, resulting in orphan objects â€” objects that are not referenced by anything, and simply occupy disk space."
msgstr ""

#: /tmp/cicero-PnJu/lo.xml:42(para) 
msgid "The <filename>lo</filename> module allows fixing this by attaching a trigger to tables that contain LO reference columns. The trigger essentially just does a <function>lo_unlink</function> whenever you delete or modify a value referencing a large object. When you use this trigger, you are assuming that there is only one database reference to any large object that is referenced in a trigger-controlled column!"
msgstr ""

#: /tmp/cicero-PnJu/lo.xml:51(para) 
msgid "The module also provides a data type <type>lo</type>, which is really just a domain of the <type>oid</type> type. This is useful for differentiating database columns that hold large object references from those that are OIDs of other things. You don't have to use the <type>lo</type> type to use the trigger, but it may be convenient to use it to keep track of which columns in your database represent large objects that you are managing with the trigger. It is also rumored that the ODBC driver gets confused if you don't use <type>lo</type> for BLOB columns."

If you need multiple <type>lo</type> columns in the same table, create a separate trigger for each one, remembering to give a different name to each trigger on the same table."
