msgid "This book uses the following typographical conventions to mark certain portions of text: new terms, foreign phrases, and other important passages are emphasized in <emphasis>italics</emphasis>. Everything that represents input or output of the computer, in particular commands, program code, and screen output, is shown in a monospaced font (<literal>example</literal>). Within such passages, italics (<replaceable>example</replaceable>) indicate placeholders; you must insert an actual value instead of the placeholder. On occasion, parts of program code are emphasized in bold face (<emphasis role=\"bold\"><literal>example</literal></emphasis>), if they have been added or changed since the preceding example."

msgid "The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command: brackets (<literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal>) indicate optional parts. (In the synopsis of a Tcl command, question marks (<literal>?</literal>) are used instead, as is usual in Tcl.) Braces (<literal>{</literal> and <literal>}</literal>) and vertical lines (<literal>|</literal>) indicate that you must choose one alternative. Dots (<literal>...</literal>) mean that the preceding element can be repeated."

msgid "An <firstterm>administrator</firstterm> is generally a person who is in charge of installing and running the server. A <firstterm>user</firstterm> could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> system. These terms should not be interpreted too narrowly; this book does not have fixed presumptions about system administration procedures."
