Also, setting the table's <literal>FILLFACTOR</literal> storage parameter to less than 100% can aid in preserving cluster ordering during updates, since updated rows are kept on the same page if enough space is available there.)"

If you are requesting a range of indexed values from a table, or a single indexed value that has multiple rows that match, <command>CLUSTER</command> will help because once the index identifies the table page for the first row that matches, all other rows that match are probably already on the same table page, and so you save disk accesses and speed up the query."
