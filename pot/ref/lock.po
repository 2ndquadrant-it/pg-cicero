msgid "When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference tables, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> always uses the least restrictive lock mode possible. <command>LOCK TABLE</command> provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking. For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the Read Committed isolation level and needs to ensure that data in a table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To achieve this you could obtain <literal>SHARE</literal> lock mode over the table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of committed data, because <literal>SHARE</literal> lock mode conflicts with the <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock acquired by writers, and your <command>LOCK TABLE <replaceable class=\"PARAMETER\">name</replaceable> IN SHARE MODE</command> statement will wait until any concurrent holders of <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding; furthermore none can begin until you release the lock."

msgid "To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the <literal>REPEATABLE READ</literal> or <literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal> isolation level, you have to execute the <command>LOCK TABLE</command> statement before executing any <command>SELECT</command> or data modification statement. A <literal>REPEATABLE READ</literal> or <literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal> transaction's view of data will be frozen when its first <command>SELECT</command> or data modification statement begins. A <command>LOCK TABLE</command> later in the transaction will still prevent concurrent writes — but it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to the latest committed values."

msgid "If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the table, then it should use <literal>SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock mode instead of <literal>SHARE</literal> mode. This ensures that only one transaction of this type runs at a time. Without this, a deadlock is possible: two transactions might both acquire <literal>SHARE</literal> mode, and then be unable to also acquire <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> mode to actually perform their updates. (Note that a transaction's own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> mode when it holds <literal>SHARE</literal> mode — but not if anyone else holds <literal>SHARE</literal> mode.) To avoid deadlocks, make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single object, then transactions should always acquire the most restrictive mode first."
