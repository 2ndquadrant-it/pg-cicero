For this reason, the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> project is planning to remove the special meaning of backslashes in strings. For backward compatibility and for users who want special backslash processing, a new string syntax has been created. This new string syntax is formed by writing an <literal>E</literal> immediately preceding the single quote that starts the string, e.g. <literal>E'hi\\n'</literal>. While this release does not change the handling of backslashes in strings, it does add new configuration parameters to help users migrate applications for future releases:"

In a future release, <varname>standard_conforming_strings</varname> will be true, meaning backslashes will be treated literally in non-E strings. To prepare for this change, use <literal>E''</literal> strings in places that need special backslash processing, and turn on <varname>escape_string_warning</varname> to find additional strings that need to be converted to use <literal>E''</literal>. Also, use two single-quotes (<literal>''</literal>) to embed a literal single-quote in a string, rather than the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>-supported syntax of backslash single-quote (<literal>\\'</literal>). The former is standards-conforming and does not require the use of the <literal>E''</literal> string syntax.
