msgid "The <filename>earthdistance</filename> module provides two different approaches to calculating great circle distances on the surface of the Earth. The one described first depends on the <filename>cube</filename> module (which <emphasis>must</emphasis> be installed before <filename>earthdistance</filename> can be installed). The second one is based on the built-in <type>point</type> data type, using longitude and latitude for the coordinates."
