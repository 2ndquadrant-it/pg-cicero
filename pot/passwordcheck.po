For example, you can use <ulink url=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cracklib/\">CrackLib</ulink> to check passwords â€” this only requires uncommenting two lines in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and rebuilding the module. (We cannot include <productname>CrackLib</productname> by default for license reasons.) Without <productname>CrackLib</productname>, the module enforces a few simple rules for password strength, which you can modify or extend as you see fit."

msgid "To prevent unencrypted passwords from being sent across the network, written to the server log or otherwise stolen by a database administrator, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows the user to supply pre-encrypted passwords. Many client programs make use of this functionality and encrypt the password before sending it to the server."

#: /tmp/cicero-cCcM/passwordcheck.xml:47(para) 
msgid "This limits the usefulness of the <filename>passwordcheck</filename> module, because in that case it can only try to guess the password. For this reason, <filename>passwordcheck</filename> is not recommendable if your security requirements are high. It is more secure to use an external authentication method such as Kerberos (see <xref linkend=\"client-authentication\"/>) than to rely on passwords within the database."

msgid "Alternatively, you could modify <filename>passwordcheck</filename> to reject pre-encrypted passwords, but forcing users to set their passwords in clear text carries its own security risks."
