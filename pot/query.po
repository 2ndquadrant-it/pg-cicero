This is called a <firstterm>self join</firstterm>. As an example, suppose we wish to find all the weather records that are in the temperature range of other weather records. So we need to compare the <structfield>temp_lo</structfield> and <structfield>temp_hi</structfield> columns of each <structname>weather</structname> row to the <structfield>temp_lo</structfield> and <structfield>temp_hi</structfield> columns of all other <structname>weather</structname> rows. We can do this with the following query: <placeholder-1/> Here we have relabeled the weather table as <literal>W1</literal> and <literal>W2</literal> to be able to distinguish the left and right side of the join. You can also use these kinds of aliases in other queries to save some typing, e.g.: <placeholder-2/> You will encounter this style of abbreviating quite frequently."

On the other hand, the <literal>HAVING</literal> clause always contains aggregate functions.
