msgid "<application>pgbench</application> is a simple program for running benchmark tests on <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. It runs the same sequence of SQL commands over and over, possibly in multiple concurrent database sessions, and then calculates the average transaction rate (transactions per second). By default, <application>pgbench</application> tests a scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five <command>SELECT</command>, <command>UPDATE</command>, and <command>INSERT</command> commands per transaction. However, it is easy to test other cases by writing your own transaction script files."
