msgid "Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to savepoints. Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed when the savepoint is rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is affected by a <command>FETCH</command> or <command>MOVE</command> command inside a savepoint that is later rolled back, the cursor remains at the position that <command>FETCH</command> left it pointing to (that is, the cursor motion caused by <command>FETCH</command> is not rolled back). Closing a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either. However, other side-effects caused by the cursor's query (such as side-effects of volatile functions called by the query) <emphasis>are</emphasis> rolled back if they occur during a savepoint that is later rolled back. A cursor whose execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a cannot-execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using <command>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</command>, the cursor can no longer be used."
