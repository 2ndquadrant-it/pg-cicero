msgid "<command>NOTIFY</command> provides a simple interprocess communication mechanism for a collection of processes accessing the same <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database.

msgid "It is up to the database designer to define the channel names that will be used in a given database and what each one means. Commonly, the channel name is the same as the name of some table in the database, and the notify event essentially means, <quote>I changed this table, take a look at it to see what's new</quote>. But no such association is enforced by the <command>NOTIFY</command> and <command>LISTEN</command> commands. For example, a database designer could use several different channel names to signal different sorts of changes to a single table. Alternatively, the payload string could be used to differentiate various cases."

msgid "When <command>NOTIFY</command> is used to signal the occurrence of changes to a particular table, a useful programming technique is to put the <command>NOTIFY</command> in a rule that is triggered by table updates. In this way, notification happens automatically when the table is changed, and the application programmer cannot accidentally forget to do it."

msgid "<command>NOTIFY</command> interacts with SQL transactions in some important ways. Firstly, if a <command>NOTIFY</command> is executed inside a transaction, the notify events are not delivered until and unless the transaction is committed. This is appropriate, since if the transaction is aborted, all the commands within it have had no effect, including <command>NOTIFY</command>. But it can be disconcerting if one is expecting the notification events to be delivered immediately. Secondly, if a listening session receives a notification signal while it is within a transaction, the notification event will not be delivered to its connected client until just after the transaction is completed (either committed or aborted). Again, the reasoning is that if a notification were delivered within a transaction that was later aborted, one would want the notification to be undone somehow â€” but the server cannot <quote>take back</quote> a notification once it has sent it to the client. So notification events are only delivered between transactions. The upshot of this is that applications using <command>NOTIFY</command> for real-time signaling should try to keep their transactions short."

msgid "If the same channel name is signaled multiple times from the same transaction with identical payload strings, the database server can decide to deliver a single notification only. On the other hand, notifications with distinct payload strings will always be delivered as distinct notifications. Similarly, notifications from different transactions will never get folded into one notification. Except for dropping later instances of duplicate notifications, <command>NOTIFY</command> guarantees that notifications from the same transaction get delivered in the order they were sent. It is also guaranteed that messages from different transactions are delivered in the order in which the transactions committed."

msgid "It is common for a client that executes <command>NOTIFY</command> to be listening on the same notification channel itself. In that case it will get back a notification event, just like all the other listening sessions. Depending on the application logic, this could result in useless work, for example, reading a database table to find the same updates that that session just wrote out. It is possible to avoid such extra work by noticing whether the notifying session's server process <acronym>PID</acronym> (supplied in the notification event message) is the same as one's own session's <acronym>PID</acronym> (available from <application>libpq</application>). When they are the same, the notification event is one's own work bouncing back, and can be ignored."

msgid "There is a queue that holds notifications that have been sent but not yet processed by all listening sessions. If this queue becomes full, transactions calling <command>NOTIFY</command> will fail at commit. The queue is quite large (8GB in a standard installation) and should be sufficiently sized for almost every use case. However, no cleanup can take place if a session executes <command>LISTEN</command> and then enters a transaction for a very long time. Once the queue is half full you will see warnings in the log file pointing you to the session that is preventing cleanup. In this case you should make sure that this session ends its current transaction so that cleanup can proceed."
