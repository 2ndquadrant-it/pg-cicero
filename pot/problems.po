It could also happen that we tell you to update to a newer version to see if the bug happens there. Or we might decide that the bug cannot be fixed before some major rewrite we might be planning is done. Or perhaps it is simply too hard and there are more important things on the agenda. If you need help immediately, consider obtaining a commercial support contract."

msgid "The most important thing to remember about bug reporting is to state all the facts and only facts. Do not speculate what you think went wrong, what <quote>it seemed to do</quote>, or which part of the program has a fault. If you are not familiar with the implementation you would probably guess wrong and not help us a bit. And even if you are, educated explanations are a great supplement to but no substitute for facts. If we are going to fix the bug we still have to see it happen for ourselves first. Reporting the bare facts is relatively straightforward (you can probably copy and paste them from the screen) but all too often important details are left out because someone thought it does not matter or the report would be understood anyway."

An easy way to create this file is to use <application>pg_dump</application> to dump out the table declarations and data needed to set the scene, then add the problem query. You are encouraged to minimize the size of your example, but this is not absolutely necessary. If the bug is reproducible, we will find it either way."

msgid "If your version is older than we will almost certainly tell you to upgrade. There are many bug fixes and improvements in each new release, so it is quite possible that a bug you have encountered in an older release of PostgreSQL has already been fixed. We can only provide limited support for sites using older releases of PostgreSQL; if you require more than we can provide, consider acquiring a commercial support contract. Platform information. This includes the kernel name and version, C library, processor, memory information, and so on. In most cases it is sufficient to report the vendor and version, but do not assume everyone knows what exactly Debian contains or that everyone runs on i386s. If you have installation problems then information about the toolchain on your machine (compiler, make, and so on) is also necessary. Do not be afraid if your bug report becomes rather lengthy. That is a fact of life. It is better to report everything the first time than us having to squeeze the facts out of you. On the other hand, if your input files are huge, it is fair to ask first whether somebody is interested in looking into it. Here is an article that outlines some more tips on reporting bugs. Do not spend all your time to figure out which changes in the input make the problem go away. This will probably not help solving it. If it turns out that the bug cannot be fixed right away, you will still have time to find and share your work-around. Also, once again, do not waste your time guessing why the bug exists. We will find that out soon enough. When writing a bug report, please avoid confusing terminology. The software package in total is called PostgreSQL, sometimes Postgres for short. If you are specifically talking about the backend process, mention that, do not just say PostgreSQL crashes. A crash of a single backend process is quite different from crash of the parent postgres process; please don't say the server crashed when you mean a single backend process went down, nor vice versa. Also, client programs such as the interactive frontend psql are completely separate from the backend. Please try to be specific about whether the problem is on the client or server side. Where to Report Bugs In general, send bug reports to the bug report mailing list at pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org. You are requested to use a descriptive subject for your email message, perhaps parts of the error message. Another method is to fill in the bug report web-form available at the project's web site. Entering a bug report this way causes it to be mailed to the pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org mailing list. If your bug report has security implications and you'd prefer that it not become immediately visible in public archives, don't send it to pgsql-bugs. Security issues can be reported privately to security@postgresql.org. Do not send bug reports to any of the user mailing lists, such as pgsql-sql@postgresql.org or pgsql-general@postgresql.org. These mailing lists are for answering user questions, and their subscribers normally do not wish to receive bug reports. More importantly, they are unlikely to fix them. Also, please do not send reports to the developers' mailing list pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org. This list is for discussing the development of PostgreSQL, and it would be nice if we could keep the bug reports separate. We might choose to take up a discussion about your bug report on pgsql-hackers, if the problem needs more review. If you have a problem with the documentation, the best place to report it is the documentation mailing list pgsql-docs@postgresql.org. Please be specific about what part of the documentation you are unhappy with. If your bug is a portability problem on a non-supported platform, send mail to pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org, so we (and you) can work on porting PostgreSQL to your platform. Due to the unfortunate amount of spam going around, all of the above email addresses are closed mailing lists. That is, you need to be subscribed to a list to be allowed to post on it. (You need not be subscribed to use the bug-report web form, however.) If you would like to send mail but do not want to receive list traffic, you can subscribe and set your subscription option to nomail. For more information send mail to majordomo@postgresql.org with the single word help in the body of the message."
