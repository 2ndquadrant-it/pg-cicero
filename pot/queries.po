This allows you to perform several different operations in the same query. An example is: <placeholder-1/> This query effectively moves rows from <structname>products</structname> to <structname>products_log</structname>. The <command>DELETE</command> in <literal>WITH</literal> deletes the specified rows from <structname>products</structname>, returning their contents by means of its <literal>RETURNING</literal> clause; and then the primary query reads that output and inserts it into <structname>products_log</structname>."

msgid "A fine point of the above example is that the <literal>WITH</literal> clause is attached to the <command>INSERT</command>, not the sub-<command>SELECT</command> within the <command>INSERT</command>. This is necessary because data-modifying statements are only allowed in <literal>WITH</literal> clauses that are attached to the top-level statement. However, normal <literal>WITH</literal> visibility rules apply, so it is possible to refer to the <literal>WITH</literal> statement's output from the sub-<command>SELECT</command>."
