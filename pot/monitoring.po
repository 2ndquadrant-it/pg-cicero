Each individual server process transmits new statistical counts to the collector just before going idle; so a query or transaction still in progress does not affect the displayed totals. Also, the collector itself emits a new report at most once per <varname>PGSTAT_STAT_INTERVAL</varname> milliseconds (500 unless altered while building the server). So the displayed information lags behind actual activity. However, current-query information collected by <varname>track_activities</varname> is always up-to-date."

msgid "Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display any of these statistics, it first fetches the most recent report emitted by the collector process and then continues to use this snapshot for all statistical views and functions until the end of its current transaction. So the statistics will show static information as long as you continue the current transaction. Similarly, information about the current queries of all sessions is collected when any such information is first requested within a transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout the transaction. This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform several queries on the statistics and correlate the results without worrying that the numbers are changing underneath you. But if you want to see new results with each query, be sure to do the queries outside any transaction block. Alternatively, you can invoke <function>pg_stat_clear_snapshot</function>(), which will discard the current transaction's statistics snapshot (if any).

When the number of actual disk reads is much smaller than the number of buffer hits, then the cache is satisfying most read requests without invoking a kernel call. However, these statistics do not give the entire story: due to the way in which <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> handles disk I/O, data that is not in the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> buffer cache might still reside in the kernel's I/O cache, and might therefore still be fetched without requiring a physical read. Users interested in obtaining more detailed information on <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> I/O behavior are advised to use the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> statistics collector in combination with operating system utilities that allow insight into the kernel's handling of I/O."

These functions are listed in <xref linkend=\"monitoring-stats-funcs-table\"/>. The per-database access functions take a database OID as argument to identify which database to report on. The per-table and per-index functions take a table or index OID. The functions for function-call statistics take a function OID. (Note that only tables, indexes, and functions in the current database can be seen with these functions.) The per-server-process access functions take a server process number, which ranges from one to the number of currently active server processes."
