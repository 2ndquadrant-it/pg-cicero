msgid "Upon creation, a constraint is given one of three characteristics: <literal>DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED</literal>, <literal>DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE</literal>, or <literal>NOT DEFERRABLE</literal>. The third class is always <literal>IMMEDIATE</literal> and is not affected by the <command>SET CONSTRAINTS</command> command. The first two classes start every transaction in the indicated mode, but their behavior can be changed within a transaction by <command>SET CONSTRAINTS</command>."

If any such constraint is violated, the <command>SET CONSTRAINTS</command> fails (and does not change the constraint mode). Thus, <command>SET CONSTRAINTS</command> can be used to force checking of constraints to occur at a specific point in a transaction."

msgid "Because <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> does not require constraint names to be unique within a schema (but only per-table), it is possible that there is more than one match for a specified constraint name.

For a non-schema-qualified name, once a match or matches have been found in some schema in the search path, schemas appearing later in the path are not searched."
