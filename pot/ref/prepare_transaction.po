msgid "<command>PREPARE TRANSACTION</command> is not intended for use in applications or interactive sessions.

This will interfere with the ability of <command>VACUUM</command> to reclaim storage, and in extreme cases could cause the database to shut down to prevent transaction ID wraparound (see <xref linkend=\"vacuum-for-wraparound\"/>). Keep in mind also that the transaction continues to hold whatever locks it held. The intended usage of the feature is that a prepared transaction will normally be committed or rolled back as soon as an external transaction manager has verified that other databases are also prepared to commit."
