msgid "<command>PREPARE</command> creates a prepared statement. A prepared statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize performance. When the <command>PREPARE</command> statement is executed, the specified statement is parsed, rewritten, and planned. When an <command>EXECUTE</command> command is subsequently issued, the prepared statement need only be executed. Thus, the parsing, rewriting, and planning stages are only performed once, instead of every time the statement is executed."

When creating the prepared statement, refer to parameters by position, using <literal>$1</literal>, <literal>$2</literal>, etc. A corresponding list of parameter data types can optionally be specified. When a parameter's data type is not specified or is declared as <literal>unknown</literal>, the type is inferred from the context in which the parameter is used (if possible). When executing the statement, specify the actual values for these parameters in the <command>EXECUTE</command> statement. Refer to <xref linkend=\"sql-execute\"/> for more information about that."

The prepared statement can be manually cleaned up using the <xref linkend=\"sql-deallocate\"/> command."

The performance difference will be particularly significant if the statements are complex to plan or rewrite, for example, if the query involves a join of many tables or requires the application of several rules. If the statement is relatively simple to plan and rewrite but relatively expensive to execute, the performance advantage of prepared statements will be less noticeable."

msgid "In some situations, the query plan produced for a prepared statement will be inferior to the query plan that would have been chosen if the statement had been submitted and executed normally. This is because when the statement is planned and the planner attempts to determine the optimal query plan, the actual values of any parameters specified in the statement are unavailable. <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> collects statistics on the distribution of data in the table, and can use constant values in a statement to make guesses about the likely result of executing the statement. Since this data is unavailable when planning prepared statements with parameters, the chosen plan might be suboptimal. To examine the query plan <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has chosen for a prepared statement, use <xref linkend=\"sql-explain\"/>."
