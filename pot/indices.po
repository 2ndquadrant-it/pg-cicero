msgid "<xref linkend=\"indexes-partial-ex2\"/> also illustrates that the indexed column and the column used in the predicate do not need to match. <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports partial indexes with arbitrary predicates, so long as only columns of the table being indexed are involved. However, keep in mind that the predicate must match the conditions used in the queries that are supposed to benefit from the index. To be precise, a partial index can be used in a query only if the system can recognize that the <literal>WHERE</literal> condition of the query mathematically implies the predicate of the index. <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> does not have a sophisticated theorem prover that can recognize mathematically equivalent expressions that are written in different forms. (Not only is such a general theorem prover extremely difficult to create, it would probably be too slow to be of any real use.) The system can recognize simple inequality implications, for example <quote>x &lt; 1</quote> implies <quote>x &lt; 2</quote>; otherwise the predicate condition must exactly match part of the query's <literal>WHERE</literal> condition or the index will not be recognized as usable. Matching takes place at query planning time, not at run time. As a result, parameterized query clauses do not work with a partial index. For example a prepared query with a parameter might specify <quote>x &lt; ?</quote> which will never imply <quote>x &lt; 2</quote> for all possible values of the parameter."

For example, a B-tree index on the type <type>int4</type> would use the <literal>int4_ops</literal> class; this operator class includes comparison functions for values of type <type>int4</type>. In practice the default operator class for the column's data type is usually sufficient. The main reason for having operator classes is that for some data types, there could be more than one meaningful index behavior. For example, we might want to sort a complex-number data type either by absolute value or by real part. We could do this by defining two operator classes for the data type and then selecting the proper class when making an index. The operator class determines the basic sort ordering (which can then be modified by adding sort options <literal>COLLATE</literal>, <literal>ASC</literal>/<literal>DESC</literal> and/or <literal>NULLS FIRST</literal>/<literal>NULLS LAST</literal>)."
