(Some systems call this the data dictionary.) The catalogs appear to the user as tables like any other, but the <acronym>DBMS</acronym> stores its internal bookkeeping in them. One key difference between <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and standard relational database systems is that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> stores much more information in its catalogs: not only information about tables and columns, but also information about data types, functions, access methods, and so on. These tables can be modified by the user, and since <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> bases its operation on these tables, this means that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> can be extended by users. By comparison, conventional database systems can only be extended by changing hardcoded procedures in the source code or by loading modules specially written by the <acronym>DBMS</acronym> vendor."

Before the extension mechanism was added to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> (in 9.1), many people wrote extension modules that simply created assorted unpackaged objects. Given an existing database containing such objects, how can we convert the objects into a properly packaged extension? Dropping them and then doing a plain <command>CREATE EXTENSION</command> is one way, but it's not desirable if the objects have dependencies (for example, if there are table columns of a data type created by the extension). The way to fix this situation is to create an empty extension, then use <command>ALTER EXTENSION ADD</command> to attach each pre-existing object to the extension, then finally create any new objects that are in the current extension version but were not in the unpackaged release. <command>CREATE EXTENSION</command> supports this case with its <literal>FROM</literal><replaceable class=\"parameter\">old_version</replaceable> option, which causes it to not run the normal installation script for the target version, but instead the update script named <literal><replaceable>extension</replaceable>--<replaceable>old_version</replaceable>--<replaceable>target_version</replaceable>.sql</literal>. The choice of the dummy version name to use as <replaceable class=\"parameter\">old_version</replaceable> is up to the extension author, though <literal>unpackaged</literal> is a common convention.
