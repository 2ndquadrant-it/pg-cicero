msgid "The built-in text search data types and functions all exist within the system schema <literal>pg_catalog</literal>. In an installation using <application>tsearch2</application>, these objects would usually have been in the <literal>public</literal> schema, though some users chose to place them in a separate schema of their own. Explicitly schema-qualified references to the objects will therefore fail in either case. The replacement <literal>tsearch2</literal> module provides alias objects that are stored in <literal>public</literal> (or another schema if necessary) so that such references will still work."

While the current parser and current dictionary were used only by functions intended for debugging, this might still pose a porting obstacle in some cases. The replacement <literal>tsearch2</literal> module emulates these additional state variables and provides backwards-compatible functions for setting and retrieving them."

msgid "The old <function>tsearch2</function> trigger function allowed items in its argument list to be names of functions to be invoked on the text data before it was converted to <type>tsvector</type> format. This was removed as being a security hole, since it was not possible to guarantee that the function invoked was the one intended. The recommended approach if the data must be massaged before being indexed is to write a custom trigger that does the work for itself."

The replacement <literal>tsearch2</literal> module offers a little bit of support for this by making it possible to load an old set of <application>tsearch2</application> configuration tables into <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 8.3. (Without the module, it is not possible to load the configuration data because values in the <type>regprocedure</type> columns cannot be resolved to functions.)
