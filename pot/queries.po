msgid "When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuples, or else the query will loop indefinitely. Sometimes, using <literal>UNION</literal> instead of <literal>UNION ALL</literal> can accomplish this by discarding rows that duplicate previous output rows. However, often a cycle does not involve output rows that are completely duplicate: it may be necessary to check just one or a few fields to see if the same point has been reached before. The standard method for handling such situations is to compute an array of the already-visited values. For example, consider the following query that searches a table <structname>graph</structname> using a <structfield>link</structfield> field: <placeholder-1/> This query will loop if the <structfield>link</structfield> relationships contain cycles. Because we require a <quote>depth</quote> output, just changing <literal>UNION ALL</literal> to <literal>UNION</literal> would not eliminate the looping. Instead we need to recognize whether we have reached the same row again while following a particular path of links. We add two columns <structfield>path</structfield> and <structfield>cycle</structfield> to the loop-prone query: <placeholder-2/> Aside from preventing cycles, the array value is often useful in its own right as representing the <quote>path</quote> taken to reach any particular row."

msgid "A useful property of <literal>WITH</literal> queries is that they are evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling <literal>WITH</literal> queries. Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be placed within a <literal>WITH</literal> query to avoid redundant work. Another possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of functions with side-effects. However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is less able to push restrictions from the parent query down into a <literal>WITH</literal> query than an ordinary sub-query. The <literal>WITH</literal> query will generally be evaluated as stated, without suppression of rows that the parent query might discard afterwards. (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of rows.)"
